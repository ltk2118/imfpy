.. py:function:: dots(country, counterparts, start, end, freq='A', form='wide')

   Highly flexible function to return time series trade data between countries from the IMF Direction of Trade (DOTS) Database.
   The function sends a get request to the IMF JSON RESTful API.

   :param country: Country code for home country.
                   Use searches.country_codes() for a list of codes.
                   Use searches.country_search("keyword") to search countries
   :type country: str (required)
   :param counterparts: Country code(s) for the counterpart country (or countries)
                        Use searches.country_codes() for a list of codes.
                        Use searches.country_search("keyword") to search countries
   :type counterparts: str or list (required)
   :param start: Start date of the series.
                 Years may be entered as int dtype, such as 1980
                 Month start dates, such as 1980.02 (float) are acceptable.
                 Numbers such as 1980.00 and 1980.14 are unacceptable.
   :type start: int or float (reqiured)
   :param end: Same as start date but end of the series.
   :type end: int or float (required)
   :param freq: Frequency of the time series (intervals)
                Default: 'A' - annual
                Alternatives: 'M' - monthly
                Note, freq "A" will override start dates entered as months, such as 1980.02
                In this case, start will be rounded down to the nearest whole year
                And end will be rounded up to the nearest whole year
   :type freq: str (optional, default='A')
   :param form: If multiple counterparts, should the returned data be wide-form or long-form?
                Default: 'wide' (MultiIndex)
                Alternatives: 'long'
   :type form: str (optional, default='A')

   :returns: **full_df** -- DataFrame with trade statistics.
             If multiple counterpart countries are selected and wide-form data is requested,
             the resulting DataFrame will be multiIndexed/hierarchical
   :rtype: pandas.core.frame.DataFrame
