# imfpy

A package for interacting with the [IMF's JSON RESTful API](https://datahelp.imf.org/knowledgebase/articles/667681-using-json-restful-web-service) with Python!! In this preliminary phase, the package is a tool for understanding, retrieving and exploring Direction of Trade Statistics (DoTS) data. 

This API client is intended to be useful for economic policymakers, researchers, government officials and more. The package enables the efficient retrieval of trade statistics from any country or country group over the span for which the IMF has data. Functions are designed to be easy-to-understand and adaptive to multiple query types.

Moving forward, I will add more functionality to each module, so that users may retrieve and analyse data from other IMF databases.

## Installation

```python
!pip install imfpy
```

Depends on:

- python 3.7 and above
- pandas 1.1.3 and above
- requests 2.19.0 and above
- matplotlib 3.2.2. and above

## Usage

The package contains three modules:  

* [`searches`](https://imfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/imfpy/searches/index.html)
* [`retrievals`](https://imfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/imfpy/retrievals/index.html)
* [`tools`](https://imfpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/autoapi/imfpy/tools/index.html)

`searches` contains many helper functions that assist the user in searching through available IMF databases, dimensions, metadata and variables. 

`retrievals` contains functions that retrieve data from important databases. 

For example, `retrievals.dots` pulls data from the DoTS database including imports, exports, two-way trade and trade balances for IMF countries and country-groups. The function handles flexible queries and formats the returned data to the user's specifications. 

```python
#Example: retrieve Greece annual trade data
>>> from imfpy.retrievals import dots
>>> dots("GR", ["US", "AU", "DE"], 2000, 2005)
```

</p>
  
`tools` contains functions that conduct rudimentary analysis and visualization on the data returned by `retrievals` functions. For example, the `dotsplot` function transforms the result of `dots()` into time series plots.

```python
#Example: plot Australia trade data
>>> from imfpy.tools import dotsplot
>>> d = dots('AU',['US','CN'], 2000, 2020, freq='A', form="long")
>>> dotsplot(d, subset=['Trade Balance', 'Twoway Trade'])
```
